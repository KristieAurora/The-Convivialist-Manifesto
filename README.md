The-Convivialist-Manifesto
==========================

This manifesto aims at naming the common point shared by the countless initiatives seeking for an alternative to the current organisation of the world. Their common point is the search for what its authors call a Convivialism, i.e. for an art of living together (con-vivere) that would allow humans to take care of each other and of Nature, without denying the legitimacy of conflict, yet by using it as a dynamizing and creativity-sparking force, a means to ward off violence and killing.
